.NET Game - Incomplete Project

This repository contains an unfinished .NET game project that I started while taking a C# course. The goal of the project is to build a simple game using .NET technologies as part of my learning process. It currently includes the foundational setup of the game, but it is not yet fully functional or complete.

Current Progress:
Basic game structure implemented

Initial classes and logic for core game functionality

Application of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts through the following classes:

-Player

       Encapsulation: Player data such as health, score, and name are protected and accessed only through public methods.
-Character

       Inheritance: The Warrior class inherits basic features from the Character class.
-Program

       Polymorfism: The Program class showcases polymorphism by utilizing a common interface for various character classes, including Warrior, Knight, Assassin, 
                    Mage, Necromancer, and Druid. Each character class inherits from the base class Character and overrides the Attack() method to provide 
                    specific behavior.
